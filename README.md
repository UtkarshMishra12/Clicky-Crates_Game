# Clicky-Crates_Game
In this Game we will  test the player’s reflexes, where the goal is to click and destroy objects randomly tossed in the air before they can fall off the screen. In creating this prototype, we will learn how to implement a User Interface - or UI - into your projects. We will add a title screen with a difficulty select menu that will control how challenging the gameplay is, we will add a score display that will track how many points the player has earned, and we will add a Game Over screen, which will allow the player to restart and try again. In learning these skills, we will be able to create a fully “playable” experience that the user can enjoy from start to finish without having to restart the application to try it again.
